# **Please note that this syllabus is now considered to  be outdated. It is using Ionic v1 which is now the legacy build. For the updated syllabus go [here](https://github.com/Jordomav/Innoved/tree/master/app-class-v2/).** 

# Introduction to App creation
In this class we will be using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). This will allow us to create fast and modern applications using JavaScript.

## A few notes for the class:
- Code will be displayed like this `var code = 'awesome'` or:
```javascript
function ionicFramework() {
    return 'Awesome Apps';
}
```
- All terms will be displayed like this __JavaScript__
- Documentation for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/) is always a great resource.
