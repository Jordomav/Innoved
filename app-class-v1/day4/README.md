# Day 4

Now we are going to create a card that will contain facts about us, such as our birthday and favorite color.
So on the `info.html` lets add this
```html
<div class="list card">

  <div class="item item-avatar">
    <img src="peter-parker.jpg">
    <h2>Peter Parker</h2>
    <p>Amazing Fantasy #15</p>
  </div>

  <div class="item item-body">
    <img class="full-image" src="spiderman.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>Favorite Color- Red</li>
        <li>Favorite Subject- Science</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>
```

Now that we have added a card about us lets add some more info to it.

With all that lets take the rest of the time to let everyone work on their different pages and add more info to the `info.html` and `likes.html`.
